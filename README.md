# Udacity Blockchain Capstone

This is the Capstone Project of Udacity Blockchain Nanodegree program done by [Stiff Roy](mailto:stiff.roy@gmail.com).  

# Contract addresses
The contracts were deployed to the Rinkeby test network and the addresses of the contracts are:

SolnSquareVerifier: `0x8100A00EFc97A9bbf3EB94806986a2C76612c52C`
SquareVerifier: `0x057743a34D66f72CbCd6B0A4c81019b8823c7AFd`

NOTE: We can focus on the [SolnSquareVerifier contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8100a00efc97a9bbf3eb94806986a2c76612c52c)

# Items deployed in the marketplace

All the items are developed with [ERC721](http://erc721.org/) standards and minted via [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/).
Later the items were deployed to the [OpenSea](https://rinkeby.opensea.io) Marketplace and can be found with the token name of [Bari](https://rinkeby.opensea.io/assets?query=bari).

# Items buy and sell history (for testing purpose only)
All the items were owned by "StiffR1" and then 5 of them were sold to "StiffR2" through OpenSea marketplace.
